# New Features
Great news! This release introduces some cool improvements to Requester.

- Requester can now source __any__ Python 3 package in its env! All you have to do is set the `packages_path` setting to a directory with Python 3 packages you'd like to include with Requester, e.g. to a virtualenv directory: `~/.virtualenvs/general/lib/python3.5/site-packages`.
  + Use any plugin in the Python ecosystem, including any auth plugin
    * `requests-oauthlib`, "https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib"
  + Use `requests-toolbelt`, "https://github.com/requests/toolbelt"
  + the `requests` and `jsonschema` packages are obviously still bundled with Requester

- Sending basic GET requests just got more convenient. Selections spanning only one line, of the form `http://google.com` or `google.com` are now transformed to `get('http://google.com')` before being sent by Requester.

- Improved syntax highlighting for requester files, as long as they are saved with the `.pyr` extension
  + You can also jump between requests in a requester file with the __Goto Symbol__ command
  + Running __Requester: New Requester File__ from the command palette creates a file with this extension
  + Read more in the __Requester Syntax Highlighting__ section of the README
