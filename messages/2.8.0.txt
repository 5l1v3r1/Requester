# New Features
Improvement to request chaining: users can "name" response to requests and reference those responses by name in subsequently executed requests. Improved syntax highlighting for response views with no valid content type in response headers.

# Code
Reorganized project so that command files, and syntax files, each have their own directory. All command files are loaded by top-level `requester.py` module.
