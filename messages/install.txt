# Welcome to Requester

Requester is an HTTP client that gives you the functionality of Postman combined with the elegance of Requests, without having to leave your text editor.

## Getting Started
From the command palette, type `Requester: Show Tutorial`.

## Issues
If you're seeing errors every time you run a request, this probably means the __requests__ dependency wasn't installed successfully. To fix this, look for __Package Control: Satisfy Dependencies__ in the command palette, run it, and restart Sublime Text.

If you find any bugs or if you think something should be added to Requester, please open an issue:
