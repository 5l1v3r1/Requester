# Requester
A __simple__ and __powerful__ Sublime Text 3 HTTP client built on top of [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/). Like Requests, it's intuitive, expressive, and __extremely easy to use__.

Requester is like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for your text editor. Get __environment variables__, __concurrent requests__, and the __famously elegant syntax__ of Requests without neutering your keyboard.
