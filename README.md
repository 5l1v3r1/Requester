# Requester: HTTP Client for Humans

![License](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/890acbdcb87868b382af9a4b1fac507b9659d9bf/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f6c6963656e73652d4d49542d626c75652e737667)

A powerful, modern HTTP client for Sublime Text 3, built on top of [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/). Like Requests, it's intuitive and easy to use.

Requester is like Postman+HTTPie for your text editor. Get environment variables, concurrent requests, multiple, editable response tabs and the elegant syntax of Requests, without neutering your keyboard.


## Features
- [Built on Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/)
  + Easily set request body, query params, custom headers, cookies
  + Persistent sessions, forms and file uploads, Wget-like downloads
- Environment variables, defined in requester file or in a separate env file
- Execute requests and display responses in parallel, or execute them serially
- Chain requests
- Edit and replay requests from individual response tabs
- Formatted, colorized output
  + Automatic syntax highlighting and pretty printing
- Clear error handling and error messages
- Lightweight, integrated test runner with support for JSON Schema


## Installation
1. Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) if you don't have it already.
2. Open the command palette <kbd>shift+cmd+p</kbd> and type __Package Control: Install Package__.
3. Search for __Requester__ (not ~~Http Requester~~) and install it.
4. __If you're seeing errors__ every time you run a request, this probably means the __requests__ dependency wasn't installed successfully. To fix this, look for __Package Control: Satisfy Dependencies__ in the command palette, run it, and restart Sublime Text.


## Getting Started
>An interactive version of this tutorial is also available. Look for __Requester: Show Tutorial__ in the command palette.

Open a file and insert the following:
~~~py
requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums')
requests.post('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums')

get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
post('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
~~~

Place your cursor on one of the lines and hit <kbd>ctrl+alt+r</kbd> (<kbd>ctrl+r</kbd> on OSX). Or, look for __Requester: Run Requests__ in the command palette and hit Enter. A response tab will appear, with a name like __GET: /albums__.

Head to the response tab and check out the response. Hit <kbd>ctrl+alt+r</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl+r</kbd> (<kbd>ctrl+r</kbd> or <kbd>cmd+r</kbd> on OSX) to replay the request. You can edit the request, which is at the top of the file, before replaying it.

Now, go back to the requester file and highlight all 5 lines, and once again execute the requests.

Tabs will open for all 4 requests (Requester conveniently ignores the blank line). Before checking out these tabs, execute the requests yet again. You'll notice duplicate requests don't create a mess of new tabs, but simply overwrite the content in the matching response tabs.

Want to see something nifty? Mix up the order of the 4 open response tabs, come back to your requester file, and run __Requester: Reorder Response Tabs__.

If you want to define requests over multiple lines, just make sure you fully highlight the requests before executing them. Try it.

~~~py
get(
  'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'
)
post(
  'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'
)
~~~

Prefixing your requests with __requests.__ is optional. If you want to close all open tabs, look for __Requester: Close All Response Tabs__ in the command palette.


### Environment Variables
It's time to add environment variables to your requests. Requester lets you to do this directly in your requester file. Just put your environment variables in a code block fenced by __###env__ lines.

~~~py
###env
base_url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com'
###env

requests.get(base_url + '/albums')
requests.post(base_url + '/albums')
~~~

Try executing these requests. Nice, huh?

The __###env__ lines must have no leading or trailing spaces. Only the first env block in a requester file will be used.


#### Separate Env File
Requester also lets you save and source your env vars from a separate env file. To do this, first you want to save your requester file. This way you can use a __relative path__ from your requester file to your env vars file, which is convenient. Save it with any name, like `requester.py`.

Next, save a file with the name `requester_env.py` in the same directory as `requester.py`, and add an env var to it.

~~~py
base_url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com'
~~~

Finally, define the path of your `env_file` in your requester file like so:

~~~py
env_file = 'requester_env.py'

requests.get(base_url + '/albums')
requests.post(base_url + '/albums')
~~~

Requester will now look for the env file at the path `requester_env.py`, which is relative to the location of the requester file. You can change this path to any relative path you want, e.g. `relative/path/to/env.py`. You can also use an __absolute path__ to the env vars file if you want.


#### Merging Vars from Env Block and Env File
Is totally fine. If a var has the same name in the env block and the env file, the var from the env file takes precedence.

Why? If you're working on a team, your requester file should probably be in version control. Static env vars and default values for dynamic env vars can be defined in the env block of your requester file.

Dynamic env vars, like a `base_url` that might point to staging one minute and production the next, can be (re)defined in an env file. Put the env file in your `.gitignore`. This way devs can tweak their envs without making useless commits or stepping on each other's toes.


### Request Body, Query Params, Custom Headers, Cookies
~~~py
get('http://httpbin.org/headers', headers={'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'})

get('http://httpbin.org/get', params={'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'})

get('http://httpbin.org/cookies', cookies={'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'})

get('http://httpbin.org/redirect-to?url=foo')
# response tab shows redirects
~~~

Body, Query Params, and Headers are passed to __requests__ as dictionaries. Cookies can be passed as a dict or an instance of `requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar`.

If you execute the last request, you'll notice the response tab shows the series of redirects followed by the browser.

If you don't know how to do something, check out __Requester: Show Tutorial__ from the command palette, or review syntax at the [Requests Quickstart](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/).


### Sessions
Need to log in first so all your requests include a session cookie? [Session objects](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#session-objects) make this a cinch. 

Instantiate the session object in the env block and use it in your requests. Copy this code to a new file and give it a try.

~~~py
###env
import requests
s = requests.Session()
s.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies/set?session_id=12345', timeout=5)
###env

s.get('http://httpbin.org/get')
~~~


### Test Runner
Requester has a built-in test runner! Copy and paste this into an empty file.

~~~py
###env
base_url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com'
prop = 'status_code'
###env

# first request
requests.get(
  base_url + '/posts'
)
assert {prop: 200, 'encoding': 'utf-8'}

# second request, with no assertion
requests.get(base_url + '/profile')

# third request
requests.get(base_url + '/comments')

assert {
  'status_code': 500
}
~~~

Highlight all the requests, look for __Requester: Run Tests__ in the command palette, and run it. You'll notice that test results are displayed for the first and third requests.

What's going on here? If a request has an assertion below it, the `key, value` pair in the assertion is compared with the returned `Response` object. If `key` is a valid property of the `Response` object, `value` is compared with the property. If they're not equal discrepancies are displayed.

Some valid properties: `apparent_encoding`, `cookies`, `encoding`, `headers`, `history`, `is_permanent_redirect`, `is_redirect`, `json`, `links`, `reason`, `status_code`, `text`, `content`.

`cookies`, `headers` and `json` point to Python dicts or lists, which means comparing for equality isn't very useful. Much more useful are the following special assertion keys for these properties: `cookies_schema` `headers_schema` `json_schema`.

Including one of these in an assertion will validate the corresponding property with [jsonschema.validate](https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema). If you have a JSON API, [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) is an excellent way to describe your API's data format. Use it.

~~~py
requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
assert {
    'json_schema': {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "body": {"type": "string"},
                "id": {"type": "number"},
                "title": {"type": "string"},
                "userId": {"type": "string"}
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~

The test runner was built for convenience:

- requests and assertions can be defined over multiple lines
- requests and assertions can use env vars
- requests without corresponding assertions are ignored
- the order of requests is preserved in the results tab

Assertions can be inserted seamlessly into a requester file; if you're not doing a test run they're simply ignored.


### Chaining Requests
If you need to run requests or tests one after another, in the order in which they're defined in your requester file, look for __Requester: Run Requests Serially__ or __Requester: Run Tests Serially__ in the command palette.

Behind the scenes, this just passes the `concurrency=1` arg to `requester` or `requester_run_tests`, and voil√†, you've chained your requests.

Note: code inside your __env block/env file__ is always run serially, which includes any requests you put in there.


#### Chaining By Reference
If you need __true__ request chaining, such that a request can reference the `Response` object returned by the previous request, that's easy too. Requester lets you reference the most recently returned response using the `Response` variable. Copy the following code to a new view, highlight it, and run __Requester: Run Requests Serially__.

~~~py
get('http://httpbin.org/get')

get('http://httpbin.org/get', params={'url': Response.json()['url']})
~~~

If you don't run requests serially, this probably won't work, because requests are executed in parallel. All the requests may have already been executed before any of the responses return, which means none of them will be able to reference the `Response` object.


## Commands
Commands defined by this package, in case you want to change key bindings.

- __requester__
- __requester_replay_request__
- __requester_run_tests__
- __requester_close_response_tabs__
- __requester_show_tutorial__
- __requester_show_documentation__
- __requester_show_syntax__
- __requester_reorder_response_tabs__: reorders response tabs to match order of requests in requester file


## Settings
- __timeout__: default timeout in seconds for all requests
  + if you want to change this for a single request, __do so directly in the response tab__, not in your requester file
- __timeout_env__: default timeout in seconds for executing env block/env file
- __change_focus_after_request__: if a single request is executed, change focus to response tab after request returns
- __change_focus_after_requests__: if multiple requests are executed, change focus to final response tab after requests return
- __reorder_tabs_after_requests__: if multiple requests are executed, automatically reorder response tabs based on requests in requester file after requests return


## Gotchas
Requester automatically includes the `timeout` argument in requests executed from your requester file. If you include this arg in your requests, __Requester will raise a SyntaxError__.

Not recommended: if you really want to disable automatic `timeout` for requests, set it to `None` in your Requester settings.

Also, __don't include inline comments on the same lines__ as multi-line requests in your requester file. For example, don't do this:

~~~py
requests.get( # comment on same line as request
  'http://mysite.com/api'
)
~~~

Doing so can lead to unexpected results.

That's it.

## Comparison
There are several HTTP clients for Sublime Text, so why Requester? Because the others lack many of the following:

- Well-documented, beautiful syntax
- Environment variables
- Multiple, editable response tabs
- Sessions and chainable requests
- File uploads and downloads
- Automatic syntax highlighting
- A test runner of any kind

Postman, Paw, and Insomnia address these concerns, but using one of these apps has its own disadvantages:

- Constantly switching contexts between HTTP client and code.
- Manipulating requests requires lots of point and click: keyboard wizardry is nearly worthless.
- Requests are stored in a proprietary format: difficult to share (usually a paid feature), difficult to add to version control.
- Requests aren't defined in a syntax literally famed for its beauty.

Requester is built from the ground up to give you the best of both worlds. It's cross-platform. It's free. Try it, see for yourself =)
