The paid collaboration features of HTTP client apps, such as sharing and versioning, are not only free in Requester, they're better. Requester works with text files, and as good as the developers at Postman and Paw are, they don't beat GitHub at collaboration, and they don't beat Git at version control.

Need to share requests with someone who doesn't use Requester? Exporting all of your requests to cURL or HTTPie takes a few seconds.

Requester is cross-platform and built for teams. If you debug web APIs for work or for fun, try it. __Try it even if you don't use Sublime Text__. You'll have to switch between two text editors, but you already have to switch between your editor and your HTTP client. Sublime Text running Requester probably has a smaller footprint than your HTTP client, and it's probably a lot easier to use. ✨✨
